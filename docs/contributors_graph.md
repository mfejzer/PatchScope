# Contributors Graph

This dashboard is meant to be
enhanced version of the Contributors subpage
in the Insights tab
for the GitHub repository
(example: <https://github.com/qtile/qtile/graphs/contributors>).

All examples are taken from **0.4.1** version of PatchScope.

## Running the app

You can run this app with `panel serve src/diffinsights_web/apps/contributors.py`
from the top directory of PatchScope sources.

The demo of this app is also available at
<https://patchscope-9d05e7f15fec.herokuapp.com/contributors>.


## Available plots

Contributors Graph dashboard provides plots (like weekly number of commits)
for the whole selected repository,
and individually for each of the top-N most active authors.

The GitHub Repo Insights offers the following plots<br>
<https://github.com/qtile/qtile/graphs/contributors>:

- Commits (commits over time)
- Additions (additions over time)
- Deletions (deletions over time)

The Contributors Graph in PatchScope's DiffInsights Web app
offers the following plots:

- Commits
- Additions
- Deletions
- Files changed
- Patch size (lines)
- Patch spreading (lines)
- Line types distribution \[%]<br>
  (area plot)
- Line types heatmap Â±\[%]
- Flow from path to line type<br>
  (Sankey diagram, not over time)
- No plot

### Commits over time

This plot shows number of commits per given period of time.
For GitHub Insights, it is weekly number of commits,
that is total number of commits in a given week.
For PatchScope, it is configurable (via sidebar widgets).

The GitHub Insights version looks like the following:

The PatchScope Contributors Graph version looks like this<br>
taken from **0.4.1** version of PatchScope,
modified to remove line types percentage info:

![](assets/screenshots/patchscope-contributors-qtile-all-commits_plot.png)

Both plots are created for the same repository;
plots created by GitHub are "live",
plots created by PatchScope are based on annotations taken at some fixed point of time.
That is one of the reasons why numbers of commits per author doesn't match
between those two apps (services).

### Additions and deletions over time

This plot shows total number of added or deleted lines over given period of time,
that is the sum of number of added/deleted lines in a commit over all commits
that were authored in a given period of time (by default: over week).

This information is extracted from unified diff of changes in the commit (patch).
Note that changing a line in this method of counting shows as deleting
the old version, and adding a new version of a line.

For example, in the following [diff from the `tqdm` repository][335308-diff]
```diff
diff --git a/README.rst b/README.rst

The GitHub Insights version of this plot looks like the following

Note that the grid of per-author plots is now sorted by the number of added lines
(the "++" line), though in this case it is the same order as sorted by the number
of commits.

GitHub Insights draws all plots using the same line color.

PatchScope's DiffInsights Web app draws
deletions using the red line color, and additions using the green line color,
just like the color when syntax-highlighting diffs (in most cases).

### Files changed over time

This plot shows the sum over given period of time (over week by default)
of number of files changed by the commit (or a patch).  The previous example
diff involved only a single file.

Note: This is not a number of unique files that were changed within given period
(for example within given week).

Here is how it looks in PatchScope (version **0.4.1**):

![](assets/screenshots/patchscope-contributors-qtile-all-files_changed.png)

Note that it counts different _file name_ in a commit (or a patch),
excluding special case of `/dev/null`.  This means that file rename
counts as changing two files for the purposes of this plot.

### Patch size and patch spreading (lines) over time

The definition of patch size and of patch spreading was taken from
the Defects4J-Dissection paper[^defects4j-dissection].

#### Patch size metric

The **_patch size_** metric is sum of the number of added, modified, and removed lines.
Lines are considered _modified_ when sequences of removed lines are straight followed by added lines ~~(or vice-versa).~~
To count each modified line, a pair of adjacent added and removed lines is needed.
The Defects4J-Dissection paper[^defects4j-dissection] shows on Listing 1 (shown below)
an example of patch with one modified line (line 635),
two non-paired removed lines (the old 636 and 639 lines),
and none non-paired added line, getting patch size of 3 lines.

![](assets/defects4j_dissection.Listing_1.Closure-40.2x.png)

You can also view the diff shown on the figure above at [Dissection of Closure 40][Closure-40-repair]
entry in the [Defects4J Dissection](https://program-repair.org/defects4j-dissection/#!/) web app
(on [program-repair.org](https://program-repair.org/)) accompanying the [defects4j-repair][] repository
that contains the raw experimental results of the experiments,
discussed in Defect4J-Repair paper[^defects4j-repair],
and referenced in Defects4J-Dissection paper[^defects4j-dissection].

Note that this diff is "Human Patch", and not [`git diff` patch text][git-diff-patch],
or [unified diff][detailed-unified], or even [context diff][detailed-context] format.

You can find the git commit corresponding to the Closure-40 patch inside
[Closure/commits-db][Closure-commit-db] CSV file in the [defects4j][] repository.
Note that [Closure/patches/40.src.patch][Closure-40-defects4j] in the same repository
is, for some reason, reverse of the "Human Patch" mentioned above.

The closest to the "Human Patch" is the diff for the [6ebc0c3d7d][6ebc0c3d7d4da7d2cf95f53d4ea790e89d3abc7a]

#### Patch spreading metric

The **_patch spreading (lines)_** metric shown in the PatchScope web app
is the second patch spreading metric from Defects4J-Dissection paper[^defects4j-dissection],
namely _spreading of chunks_ in a patch.

A _chunk_ is defined in Defects4J-Dissection[^defects4j-dissection] as
a sequence of continuous changes in a file, consisting of the combination of
addition, removal, and modification of lines.  We will call it a _change group_
to avoid confusion with _hunk_ as defined by (unified) diff format.

The measure _spreading of chunk_ / _chunks spreading_ , we consider the number of lines
interleaving chunks (change groups).  In a patch with only one chunk, this value
is naturally zero, because such patch represents a continuous sequence of changes.
In a patch with two chunks, at least one line separates the chunks.
For patches involving more than one file, we sum the spreading of chunks of all files
to get the final spreading of the patch.

For the Closure-40 patch on Listing 1 figure above,
between the old line 636 (end of the first chunk)
and the old line 639 (beginning of the second chunk)
there is only 2 lines, which is the value of the
_spreading of chunks_ metric in this case.

Here is how it looks in PatchScope (version **0.4.1**):

![](assets/screenshots/patchscope-contributors-qtile-all-patch_spreading.png)

Note that empty and comment lines were discarded for _chunk spreading_ calculations
in Defects4J-Dissection paper[^defects4j-dissection], but this was **not** done
in the PatchScope pipeline (patch annotation) and visualization.
